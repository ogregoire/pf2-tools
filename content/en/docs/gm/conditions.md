**Source:** Player Core pg. 443

## All Conditions

**Blinded:** You can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you.

**Broken:** Objects with damage equal to or greater than their Broken Threshold gain this condition. A broken object can't be used for its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses.

**Clumsy:** You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Dexterity-based checks and DCs, including AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, and skill checks using Dexterity.

**Concealed:** While you're concealed from a creature, such as in a thick fog, you are difficult for that creature to see. You can still be observed, but you're hard enough to see that it requires a successful DC 5 flat check for a creature to target you with an attack, spell, or other effect.

**Confused:** You attack indiscriminately. You can't take reactions, and you must use all your actions to Strike or cast offensive cantrips, though you can choose your targets randomly each turn.

**Controlled:** Someone else is making your decisions for you, usually because you're being commanded or magically dominated. The controller dictates how you act and can make you use any of your actions, including attacks, reactions, or even Delay.

**Dazzled:** Your precise senses are impaired by overpowering light. While dazzled, you can still see, but all creatures and objects are concealed from you.

**Deafened:** You can't hear. You automatically fail Perception checks that require you to hear, and you take a –2 status penalty to Perception checks for initiative and checks that involve sound but also rely on other senses.

**Doomed:** Your soul is being torn from your body. Doomed decreases the dying value at which you die.

**Drained:** Blood loss or something similar has leached your vitality. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value on Constitution-based checks and DCs, including Fortitude saves and checks to recover from diseases and poisons.

**Dying:** You are unconscious and near death. While dying, you can't act. When you're reduced to 0 Hit Points, you become dying 1.

**Encumbered:** You are carrying more weight than you can manage. While encumbered, you're clumsy 1 and take a 10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.

**Enfeebled:** You're physically weakened. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Strength-based rolls and DCs, including Strength-based melee attack rolls, Strength-based damage rolls, and Athletics checks.

**Fascinated:** You are compelled to focus your attention on something. You take a –2 status penalty to Perception and skill checks, and you can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they or their intended consequences are related to the subject of your fascination.

**Fatigued:** You're tired and can't summon much energy. You take a –1 status penalty to AC and saving throws.

**Fleeing:** You're forced to run away due to fear or some other compulsion. On your turn, you must spend each of your actions trying to escape the source of the fleeing condition.

**Friendly:** This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and it affects only creatures that are not player characters.

**Frightened:** You're gripped by fear and struggle to control your nerves. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to all your checks and DCs.

**Grabbed:** A creature, object, or magic holds you in place. You're off-guard and can't move except to Escape or force your way free.

**Helpful:** This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and it affects only creatures that are not player characters.

**Hidden:** While you're hidden from a creature, that creature knows where you are but can't see you. You typically become hidden by using Stealth to Hide.

**Hostile:** This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and it affects only creatures that are not player characters.

**Immobilized:** You can't use actions with the move trait. If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense of the creature holding you.

**Indifferent:** This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and it affects only creatures that are not player characters.

**Invisible:** Creatures can't see you. You're undetected by all creatures. Creatures can guess where you are from hearing you, making you hidden to them instead of undetected.

**Off-Guard:** You're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to AC.

**Paralyzed:** Your body is frozen in place. You have the off-guard condition and can't act except to Recall Knowledge and use actions that require only your mind.

**Persistent Damage:** Persistent damage comes from effects like acid or burning and appears as "persistent [type] damage" or "persistent damage [amount] [type]." Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns.

**Petrified:** You have been turned to stone. You can't act, nor can you sense anything. You become an object with a Hardness equal to that of the stone you've become.

**Prone:** You're lying on the ground. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are Crawl and Stand.

**Quickened:** You gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round. Many effects that make you quickened specify the types of actions you can use with this additional action.

**Restrained:** You're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the off-guard and immobilized conditions, and you can't use any actions with the attack or manipulate traits except to attempt to Escape or Force Open your bonds.

**Sickened:** You feel ill. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value on all your checks and DCs.

**Slowed:** You have fewer actions. Slowed always includes a value. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions you regain by your slowed value.

**Stunned:** You've become senseless. You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they or their intended consequences are related to the subject that stunned you.

**Stupefied:** Your thoughts and instincts are clouded. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks and DCs, including Will saves, spell attack rolls, spell DCs, and skill checks that use these ability scores.

**Unconscious:** You're sleeping or have been knocked out. You can't act. You take a –4 status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and off-guard conditions.

**Undetected:** When you are undetected by a creature, that creature cannot see you at all, has no idea what space you occupy, and can't target you.

**Unfriendly:** This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and it affects only creatures that are not player characters.

**Unnoticed:** You're in a creature's blind spot or otherwise avoiding their notice entirely. A creature that fails to notice you is unaware of your presence.

**Wounded:** You're hurt and bleeding. Wounded always includes a value, and if you gain the dying condition, you increase your dying value by your wounded value.
